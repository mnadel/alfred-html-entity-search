# Alfred HTML Entity Search Workflow

Search for and copy HTML entity characters to your clipboard. Makes it easy to copy symbols such as &dagger; and &copy; for use in writing.

You can enter multiple search terms. It searches the description of the entity as well as the entity code and its aliases. For example, `html dagger` will return a dagger and a double dagger; `html dagger do` will limit the results to the double dagger.
